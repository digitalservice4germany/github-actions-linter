# GitHub Actions Linter

Linting for GitHub Actions workflows:

- Detects referencing 3rd-party actions by mutable tags/references. The only actions allowed to be referenced in this way are actions created by GitHub itself.

```yml
# ❌ Bad
- name: Send status to Slack
  uses: lazy-actions/slatify@v3.0.0

- name: Send status to Slack
  uses: lazy-actions/slatify@main

# ✅ Good
- name: Send status to Slack
  uses: lazy-actions/slatify@c4847b8c84e3e8076fd3c42cc00517a10426ed65 # == v3.0.0
```
